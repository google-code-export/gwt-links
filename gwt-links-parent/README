|   HOW TO INSTALL THE PROJECT    |
-----------------------------------

1 - Checkout the project with this command : 
svn checkout https://gwt-links.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gwt-links-parent gwt-links-parent

2 - Go to the directory "gwt-links-parent"
cd gwt-links-parent

3 - Make sure Maven is installed by running mvn -v. If it is not, download it !

4 - Launch installDnd.sh (or .bat) if you are on an UNIX platform (or Windows)
./installDnd.sh 
or
installDnd.bar

5 - Run the following command to install the modules on your maven repository
mvn install

6 - If the previous command failed.... grab a snicker, go on 9gag and try it later !
    (Try to run mvn build first after a mvn clean. Turn maven into verbose mode to debug what goes wrong)

    If the previous command succeeded : yes, you can go to advice #7 !

7 - Open Eclipse (and install GWT Plugin for Eclipse if you haven't yet installed)

8 - Import "gwt-links" and "gwt-links-demo" as a Maven Project in Eclipse

9 - Right-click on gwt-links-demo > Properties. 
	In menu "Google" > "Web Toolkit", check "Use Google Web Toolkit Project" and choose your GWT SDK
	In menu "Google" > "Web Application", check "This application has a war directory" and set "src/main/webapp" as the war directory

FINALLY : Right-click on gwt-link-demo > Run as... > Web application !

			You did it \o/
